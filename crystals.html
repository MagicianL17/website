		   <p class="lead">Crystallization From Solution</p>
          <p>The sugar molecules within the prepared (hot) solution are dissolved in water. How much the solution can hold depends on two things: the temperature of the water, and how much water there is. The hotter the water, the more sugar we expect to be able to dissolve into it (temperature-dependent <em>solubility</em>).</p>
		   <p>If we prepare a hot solution and allow it to cool, we achieve what is called a <em>supersaturated</em> state. Supersaturation means that the solution has more sugar dissolved than it can have at equilibrium at this cooler temperature. Over time, we’d expect the excess sugar to <em>precipitate</em>: to ‘un-dissolve’ and come out of the water as solid crystals. However, this would deposit crystals somewhat randomly at the edge of the glass jar/on the surface and would take quite a while to form any crystals big enough to eat.</p>
		   <p>To speed the process and also to make it easier to take out and eat, we use a stick or string. The rough surface of these items placed inside the solution provides <em>nucleation sites</em> where the molecules can cling to as they fall out of the solution. With time, water is lost from the solution through evaporation and the temperature is allowed to cool further (slow cooling is best!). With lowered temperature and less water, the solution remains supersaturated and will precipitate out more sugar solid. With good seed crystals in place, additional layers of sugar grow and form the large crystals we will get to appreciate and maybe eat. </p>
          <p>Crystals come in a huge variety of shapes and colors, which depend on the types of molecules or atoms that form the crystal as well as the specific arrangement of these components. In pure substances, crystallization happens as it is cooled below the melting point. Many molecules actually are <em>allotrophic</em>, or have several different ways of arranging themselves in crystals, and so form different crystal structures under different conditions. Chocolate is a great example of this, having six easily distinguishable crystal structures (though we mostly only ever see form 5, which melts perfectly at body temperature). Even one of the simplest molecules, water, has more than a dozen different crystal structures possible at different temperatures + pressures. </p>

		   <p>Since temperature affects solubility, what happens if you put the jars in the fridge so they cool more quickly, or insulate them to keep the heat in?</p>
		   <p>You might have other solutes at home, like table salt, Epsom salts, or borax. What happens if you use one of those instead of sugar? (Skip the eating part!)</p>
		   <p>What happens if you have two solutes in the same solution, like sugar and salt? What happens if you use a different solvent, like juice or vinegar? </p>

		   <ul>
			   <li><strong>Solution:</strong> A group of two (or more) different substances that are mixed and evenly distributed. We made a solution out of a solid and a liquid, but any state of matter can be part of a solution. Air is a solution of gases, and metal alloys are solutions of solids. Can you think of a solution of liquids? What about a gas-liquid solution? <small><em>(Hint: There's one that you can drink.)</em></small></li>
			   <li><strong>Solute:</strong> The substance being dissolved.</li>
			   <li><strong>Solvent:</strong> The substance doing the dissolving.</li>
			   <li><strong>Substrate:</strong> The underlying layer that the crystals will grow on.</li>
			   <li><strong>Solubility:</strong> The amount of solute that can be dissolved by a solvent. Solubility is very closely related to temperature and pressure.</li>
			   <li><strong>Saturation:</strong> The point where, under normal (usually room-temperature) circumstances, no more solute will dissolved in a solvent.</li>
			   <li><strong>Supersaturation:</strong> When a solution holds more solute than it would under normal circumstances.</li>
			   <li><strong>Crystal:</strong> A form of solid where the molecules are arranged in a regular repeating pattern called a crystal lattice. Table salt is another common crystal, as are many gemstones.</li>

		   </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-6">
  		   <ul>
			   <li><strong>Precipitate:</strong> When a solute falls out of a solution, typically because the temperature or pressure has changed and therefore changed the solubility. We caused the sugar to precipitate out by letting the solution cool down, and rain and snow happen when water vapor precipitates out of air. Can you think of any other examples of precipitation? <small><em>(Hint: Think about the drink from earlier.)</em></small></li>
			   <li><strong>Allotrophic:</strong> When a substance can form multiple types of crystal lattices, which can look and act very differently. Chocolate is one example of an allotrophic substance, and another one is carbon. The graphite in pencils is one form of carbon crystal-- can you guess what the other one is? <small><em>(Hint: It's a gemstone.)</em></small></li>
			   <li><strong>Nucleation:</strong> The process of molecules assembling themselves into larger particles, like raindrops or crystals, as they precipitate out of a solution. This starts at a nucleation site, which can be one of the molecules but it's much more common for it to be an impurity in the solution or a rough surface like the wooden skewers we grew the sugar crystals on. Water typically forms crystals at 0C (32F), but if enough impurities are removed, it's possible to cool it down even further without it turning into ice. Very small droplets of 100% pure water have been known to remain liquid all the way down to -30C! (-22F).</li>
